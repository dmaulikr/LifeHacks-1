# How to AGILE
_Fundamental shift in 2001_ 

Waterfall: You know the scope and create the time and costs along the project.

AGILE: You know the time and resources (costs) and create the scope along the way. 


## 4 Principles

1. Individuals and Interactions over processes and tool
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiations
4. Respondig to change over following a plan

## Advantages 

* Customer focused
* Flexibility central
* Focused on improvement
* Full disclosure
* Team culture
* Risks & issues identifiied very quickly
* Frequent checkpoints
* Easier reporting
* Roadmap

## SCRUM

_An Agile development option._

Features are known as user stories
stored in Product backlog (wishlist of the user)

Product owner: Decide on features in backlog and talks to the customer.
Scrum Master: Check if progressing smoothly, team leader, keep people disciplined for the 15mins daily meeting.
Team Members: Developers and testers.

### Scrum Process Cicle


Scrum Sprint
Release Planning 
Identifiy userstories in the release backlog

Estimated work for release

Estimates in story points or in hours.
Sprint: from 2 days to 30 days. 
Release has several sprints.
Subset of release backlog gets ready ahead. 

Use a burndown chart to monitor sprints. Shows the amount of work remaining. 

For each estimate you define the work remaining at the end of the day.
Daily meetings to discuss the progress of the team

After each sprint: Retrospective meeting.

Tools: [OnTime](axosoft.com)

Sprints take optionally about 2 weeks. After each sprint you make a sprint review. 
The Product Backlog is a set of all backlog items that need to be fulfilled for the product.
The Sprint Backlog defines the items that need to be completed for this sprint.

Groom Session: Re-evaluate items in respect on the changed requirements and wishes form the customer.

User Stories: The desired deliverables (aka. What is neede)
>As a [user role]
>I want to [desired feature]
>so that [value/benefit]

Epics: Large user stories. 
Sprints:  Fixed-lenght iterations from 2-4 weeks long. 
Daily Stand-up Meetings: Every day the team meets and tells each other what they were working on the day before, this day and what problems they are facing. This flags risks and issues and makes the team members commit to each other.

Blockers: Any impediments that are raised in the daily stand-up meeting become the Scrum Master's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible.

Deliverable: User stories deliverd with each sprint.
Sprint Review Meetings: The team shows what has been accomplished. The Product Owner should be invited (and probaly even the customer).

Retrospectives: Special meetings that take place at the end of a sprint. The team steps back, examines the way they work, analyses and identifies ways they can improve. 

Delivery: Story points and burndown charts
Story Points: Time and effort. An estimation of how long it will take to complete a user story. 
Burndown chart: Shows work accomplished and work remaining. 

Scrum Process: Vision -> Product Backlog -> Sprint Backlog -> Deliverables

## Agile in practise

Problem analysis: A3 Root-Cause Analysis, Ishikawa-Fishbone Diagram, PDCA - Plan Do Check Act, 

## Story Boards

Scrum is used for development groups. Kanban sequential activities. 

WIP Limits: Work in progress limits. 

User stories are made into cards. These cards have their own color (which identifies their nature or type).

## Grooming Sessions: Product Owner looks at the items

**M**o**SC**o**W**: **M**ust **S**hould **C**ould **W**ould (/Would not)

1. Write down requirements
2. Place in the 4 categories above
3. Rank within the categories
