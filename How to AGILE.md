# How to AGILE
_Fundamental shift in 2001_ 

**Note:** This is still a draft. 

Waterfall: You know the scope and create the time and costs along the project.

AGILE: You know the time and resources (costs) and create the scope along the way. 


## 4 Principles

1. Individuals and Interactions over processes and tool
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiations
4. Respondig to change over following a plan

## Advantages 

* Customer focused
* Flexibility central
* Focused on improvement
* Full disclosure
* Team culture
* Risks & issues identifiied very quickly
* Frequent checkpoints
* Easier reporting
* Roadmap

## SCRUM

_An Agile development option._

Features are known as user stories
stored in Product backlog (wishlist of the user)

Product owner: Decide on features in backlog and talks to the customer.
Scrum Master: Check if progressing smoothly, team leader, keep people disciplined for the 15mins daily meeting.
Team Members: Developers and testers.

### Scrum Process Cicle


Scrum Sprint
Release Planning 
Identifiy userstories in the release backlog

Estimated work for release

Estimates in story points or in hours.
Sprint: from 2 days to 30 days. 
Release has several sprints.
Subset of release backlog gets ready ahead. 

Use a burndown chart to monitor sprints. Shows the amount of work remaining. 

For each estimate you define the work remaining at the end of the day.
Daily meetings to discuss the progress of the team

After each sprint: Retrospective meeting.

Tools: [OnTime](axosoft.com)

Sprints take optionally about 2 weeks. After each sprint you make a sprint review. 
The Product Backlog is a set of all backlog items that need to be fulfilled for the product.
The Sprint Backlog defines the items that need to be completed for this sprint.

Groom Session: Re-evaluate items in respect on the changed requirements and wishes form the customer.

User Stories: The desired deliverables (aka. What is neede)
>As a [user role]
>I want to [desired feature]
>so that [value/benefit]

Epics: Large user stories. 
Sprints:  Fixed-lenght iterations from 2-4 weeks long. 
Daily Stand-up Meetings: Every day the team meets and tells each other what they were working on the day before, this day and what problems they are facing. This flags risks and issues and makes the team members commit to each other.

Blockers: Any impediments that are raised in the daily stand-up meeting become the Scrum Master's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible.

Deliverable: User stories deliverd with each sprint.
Sprint Review Meetings: The team shows what has been accomplished. The Product Owner should be invited (and probaly even the customer).

Retrospectives: Special meetings that take place at the end of a sprint. The team steps back, examines the way they work, analyses and identifies ways they can improve. 

Delivery: Story points and burndown charts
Story Points: Time and effort. An estimation of how long it will take to complete a user story. 
Burndown chart: Shows work accomplished and work remaining. 

Scrum Process: Vision -> Product Backlog -> Sprint Backlog -> Deliverables

## Agile in practise

Problem analysis: A3 Root-Cause Analysis, Ishikawa-Fishbone Diagram, PDCA - Plan Do Check Act, 

## Story Boards

Scrum is used for development groups. Kanban sequential activities. 

WIP Limits: Work in progress limits. 

User stories are made into cards. These cards have their own color (which identifies their nature or type).

## Grooming Sessions: Product Owner looks at the items

**M**o**SC**o**W**: **M**ust have, **S**hould have, **C**ould have, **W**ould like 

1. Write down requirements
2. Place in the 4 categories above
3. Prioritise within each category 

In practice these session are in very small groups.

## Sprint Planning

Poker Method: Every team member has a set of cards. Each member shows points given. 2 most extreme numbers discuss why they chose it to reach a consensus.

T-shirt Sizing Method: Every team member says which size a item has. Same effect as before

These estimations will be used to define the deliverables for each sprint.

Fist of Five Technique: Each team member shows how much they want to do a task (from 1 to 5)

Delphi Method: One after each other someone says what they want to say. Then you do a second round. 

## Retrospective Methods

For each team member: 

Analysis: What went well? What could be improved?
Action: What to STOP doing? What to KEEP doing? What to START doing?

## Reporting

KPI Reporting: Status, Baselines, Milestones, Burndown, Risks & Issues, Defects & Blockers, New & Outstanding Items.

## Best practise

Common traps with sprint planning:

* Story Points are a nightmare -> Steer away from complex notions, just use hours
* Huge epics -> Brake up epics into smaller user stories
* Carry-over of user stories -> Carrying over is ok, but within limit
* Perpetual user stories -> User stories should be wrapped up
* No burndown chart -> Burndown charts are an essential part of visualization
* Reluctant estimation -> Accurate estimation is an ongoing process; estimation always improves over time
* Too short -> Planning improves quality and efficiency
* Risk & issues ignored .> Planning needs to look at roadblocks ahead
