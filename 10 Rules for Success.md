# 10 Rules for Success

**Note:** Still a work in progress. I want to finish this draft asap though.
  
  ## Ask great questions
  
  To watch interviews with succe
  
  Thinking is the process of asking questions. If you get better at asking other ppl questions you get better at asking yourself questions.
  
  ## Start Small
  
  If you need to do many things.
  Which one of these makes all of the rest easier to do or irrelevant. 
  
  In the beginning: Too less than you are capable of doing. 
  E.g. flossing; to start only gonna floss my front four teeth. 
  
  Lower your standards.
  E.g. if you can't write, make it a goal to write just one sentence. 
  
  **Result:** You will feel succesful and you will exceed that for some extra credits (so you probably will do more)
  
  ## Be Focused
  
  If you scatter your focus you will be
  
  What is the one project if succesful it will render the other projects irrelevant?
  
  ## Unplug and Reset
  
  Giving everyone around you and everyone in the world immediate access to you is inviting interruption.
  Time-manag
  
  You need to take a step back and see what's wasting your time.
  
  1. Definition: find your ideal lifestyle. What do you want to be doing from when you get up to whwen you go to sleep? 
  The cost of this is going to be your target.
  
  2. Elimimination: Get rid of everything. All the static, all the noise, all the interruptions, all the micro-managing, all the people
  that interfere with getting you to your ideal life-style
  
  3. Automation: Taking the few remaining tasks that are either important or time-consuming and either delegating, automating or somehow outsourcing them.
  
  4. Liberation: Mobility. Use the time you created.
  
  26% of the ppl of the US are on the verge on a nerve breakdown.
  
  Finally: Use an auto-responder for email and calls. 
  E.g. *Hi, I check my emails twice a day and will come back to you as soon as possible*
  
  ## Accept the collateral damage
  
  You have to let small bad things happen to have any agenda of your own, to get the positive things done.
  
  ## Try the five minute journal method
  
  2.5 minutes in the morning and in the night. To write down what are your priorities and what you are grateful for. 
  Morning: prio
  Night: performance review
  
  ## Schedule your time
  
  2-4 hours uninterrupted blocks of time to look at your high-priority projects. To do all the planning, re-scheduling and to reset priorities or goals. 
  
  *"If you don't have time you don't have priorities."*
  
  ## Get Feedback
  
  Early feedback is critical but you don't have to make it public. Start with a small group who represent demographics. 
  
 Do fast sprints (2 weeks), push something out, get feedback.
 
 ## Simply
 
 If you are looking for a solution try to remove things first, rather than to add things.
 Less can be more, especially for behavioral change.
 
 Cut away other options. Perfection is achiaved if there is nothing more to take away.
 
 ## Do Acroyoga
 
 ...or anything similar in that perspective. Be sure to also work out your body to conquer your mind.
