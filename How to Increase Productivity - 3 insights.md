Here are my top 3 insights from Gary Kellers incredibly practical book 'The One Thing'.

**1. Domino Effect:**

A domino can knock over another domino that's 50% larger than itself, when dominos are knocked over a chain reaction occurs. If the first domino was 5mm it would take 29 progressively larger dominos to knock out the Empire state building (do the math! Crazy shit). Do the same for your life by always looking for the leading domino, your current most important task. Use the momentum of each objective hit to knock down the next, like our domino friend.

**2. Extreme 80/20:**

The 80/20 rule (also called pareto principle) states that there is an uneven spread of importance of tasks. Often 80% of your results will come from 20% of you efforts.

* 20% of your customers usually account for 80% of your profits.
* 20% of your investments usually account for 80% of your returns.
* 20% of your habits usually result in 80% of your success.

Find the task that leads to the greatest amount of results and double down on that. Work smarter not harder for the best results. Strategy is everything when it comes to productivity.

**3. Willpower on will call:**

Our willpower reserves deplete over time due to 'Ego Depletion', our willpower gets used up when we do things such as:

* Filtering distractions
* Taking exams
* Choosing the long term gratification over short term 

In order to not be as effected by Ego Depletion it is best to perform our highest priority task first. That means you do it as soon as possible before the excuses start rolling in! ~Brian Tracy~ Mark Twain calls this *eating the frog*
