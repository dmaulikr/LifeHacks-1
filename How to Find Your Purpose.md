**Purpose:** To develop an emotion within onself and provide it as a service to others.

The questions is: What's the emotion you want to achieve with a goal?
Understand who **you** are as a human.

Regarding relationships: "You either grow together or you grow apart"

1. Look at the memories, that are the best memories. How was I back then? What were those emotions?

2. Look at areas in your life that don't fit that purpose (feeling). What has to happen for you to feel like "back then"?

3. List top 10 things you are most afraid of. 

Your biggest fear and areas you are struggeling are related. 
Once you figured it out on how you wanna feel: what's gonna bring you long-term success outside of yourself? (bigger scope / others)
