**Long Version:**

**1. Add description & timing** – when you set a meeting, add a clear description, structured agenda and proposed timing. Do your best to follow it

**2. Organize pre-meeting** – sometimes 10 minutes internal brainstorming session about meeting beforehand could be very useful to align expectations and define what you really want to achieve with this meeting

**3. Stick to the right stakeholders** – when inviting more people to attend the meeting, always doubt if they are bringing additional value to the final purpose of the meeting. If not – do not waste their time, you can always brief them later

**4. Add visuals** – add pictures/slides/info graphics/mind maps to make the meeting more interactive and keep the audience focused

**5. Distribute notes** – take high-level notes and distribute them afterward

**6. Define action plan** – the meeting was just a waste of time if you did not set a clear actionable to-do list to proceed further

**7. Set timeline & the owner** – no action point should be left without the deadline & the person in charge

**8. Follow up** – do not forget to follow up on the to-dos and deadlines. Better do it even before the deadline approaches
