# How to Prioritize Projects

*draft*

Projects should fulfill the following three goals:

* Give you **access** to sth. (e.g. Bachelors degree for Master or Google intership for a job there) or generate a **ressource** (e.g. dimploma or references)
* Improve your **image** or add values to your **role** (e.g. Engineer)
* Create new **experience** or fortify your **skill**
