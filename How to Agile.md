# How to Agile
_Fundamental shift in 2001_ 

Waterfall: You know the scope and create the time and costs along the project.

Agile: You know the time and resources (costs) and create the scope along the way. 


## 4 Principles

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiations
4. Respondig to change over following a strict plan

## Advantages 

* Customer focused
* Flexibility 
* Focused on improvement
* Full disclosure
* Team culture
* Risks & issues identifiied very quickly
* Frequent checkpoints
* Easier reporting
* Roadmap

# Scrum

_An Agile development option._

Features are known as User Stories.
These are stored in the Product Backlog (wishlist of the user). 

**Product owner:** Decides on features in backlog and talks to the customer.
**Scrum Master:** Team Leader. Checks if the project is progressing smoothly. Keeps people disciplined for the 15mins daily meeting.
**Team Members:** Developers and testers.

## Scrum Process Cicle

* Scrum Sprint
* Release Planning 
* Identifiy userstories in the release backlog
* Estimated work for release

* Estimates in story points or in hours
* Sprint: from 2 days to 30 days
* Release has several sprints
* Subset of release backlog gets ready ahead

Use a burndown chart to monitor sprints. Shows the amount of work remaining. 

For each estimate you define the work remaining at the end of the day.
Daily meetings to discuss the progress of the team. 

After each sprint: Retrospective meeting.

Tools: [OnTime](axosoft.com)

Sprints should take about 2 weeks. After each sprint you make a sprint review. 
The Product Backlog is a set of all backlog items that need to be fulfilled for the product.
The Sprint Backlog defines the items that need to be completed for this sprint.

## Definitions

**Groom Session:** Re-evaluate items in respect on the changed requirements and wishes form the customer.

**User Stories:** The desired deliverables (aka. What is neede)
>As a [user role]
>I want to [desired feature]
>so that [value/benefit]

**Epics:** Large user stories. 

**Sprints:**  Fixed-lenght iterations from 2-4 weeks long. 

**Daily Stand-up Meetings:** Every day the team meets and tells each other what they were working on the day before, this very day and what problems they are facing. This flags risks and issues and makes the team members commit to each other.

**Blockers:** Any impediments that are raised in the daily stand-up meeting become the Scrum Master's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible.

**Deliverables:** User stories deliverd with each sprint.

**Sprint Review Meetings:** The team shows what has been accomplished. The Product Owner should be invited (and probaly even the customer).

**Retrospectives:** Special meetings that take place at the end of a sprint. The team steps back, examines the way they work, analyses and identifies ways they can improve. 

**Delivery:** Story points and burndown charts

**Story Points:** Time and effort. An estimation of how long it will take to complete a user story. 

**Burndown chart:** Shows work accomplished and work remaining. 

**Scrum Process:** Vision -> Product Backlog -> Sprint Backlog -> Deliverables

## Agile in practise

Tools for the problem analysis: A3 Root-Cause Analysis, Ishikawa-Fishbone Diagram, PDCA - Plan Do Check Act.

## Story Boards

Scrum is used for development groups. Kanban for sequential activities. 

**WIP Limits:** Work in progress limits. These are set on each list on the board. 

E.g. Doing List WIP Limit = 3 -> This means one person can only be working on 3 items at a time. 

User stories are made into cards. These cards have their own color (which identifies their nature or type). 

## Grooming Sessions: The Product Owner looks at The Items

**M**o**SC**o**W**: **M**ust have, **S**hould have, **C**ould have, **W**ould like 

1. Write down requirements
2. Place in the 4 categories above
3. Prioritise within each category 

In practice these session are in very small groups.

## Sprint Planning

**Poker Method:** Every team member has a set of cards. Each member shows points given. 2 most extreme numbers discuss why they chose it to reach a consensus.

**T-shirt Sizing Method:** Every team member says which size a item has. Same effect as before.

These estimations will be used to define the deliverables for each sprint.

**Fist of Five Technique:** Each team member shows how much they want to do a task (from 1 to 5).

**Delphi Method:** One after each other someone says what they want to say. Then you do a second round. This way everybody speaks up and they get a chance to correct themselves after the first round.

## Retrospective Methods

Each member of the team has to answer these five questions from the following two categories:  

1. Analysis: What went well? What could be improved?
2. Action: What to STOP doing? What to KEEP doing? What to START doing?

## Reporting

**KPI Reporting:** Status, Baselines, Milestones, Burndown, Risks & Issues, Defects & Blockers, New & Outstanding Items.

## Best Practise

### Common traps with Sprint Planning:

* Story Points are a nightmare -> Steer away from complex notions, just use hours
* Huge epics -> Brake up epics into smaller user stories
* Carry-over of user stories -> Carrying over is ok, but within limit
* Perpetual user stories -> User stories should be wrapped up
* No burndown chart -> Burndown charts are an essential part of visualization
* Reluctant estimation -> Accurate estimation is an ongoing process; estimation always improves over time
* Too short -> Planning improves quality and efficiency
* Risk & issues ignored -> Planning needs to look at roadblocks ahead
* No backlog grooming -> Requirements have to be re-evaluated before planning the next sprint; top items only
* People missing -> Team commitment requires an entire team
* Limited participation -> The Scrum Master must involve everybody present

### Common traps with Stand-Up Meetings:

* Too long -> 15 Minutes max; Use a clock
* Discussions -> Save it for immediately afterwards
* Story tellers -> The Scrum Master should keep the team focused
* Blockers not mentioned -> Everyone should say whether or not they have one / some
* People don't pay attention -> Rotate daily who's next to speak
* People look at their laptop -> It's a "stand-up" meeting for a reason
* No visualizaiton -> Status needs to be visiually tracked
* Late arrivals -> Start on time regardless

### Recipe for a successful Stand-Up Meeting:

* Come prepared
* Answer the three questions
* Be on time
* Be specific
* Avoid sounding busy
* Not the time to solve problems

### The extra mile...

* Managers should attend sporadically
* Invite executives for major milestones
* Recognition Plaques

### on Review Meetings:

* Risks & issues forgotten -> Mondays and Fridays people are often not prepared

### on Retropspectives:

* Record recommendations and send them out afterwards.

## Agile Process Implementation

**Phase 1**

1. Form Agile Committee
2. A3 Root Cause Analysis
3. Agile Training
4. Create Product Backlog
5. Sprint Zero Planning

**Phase 2**

6. Create Scrumboard
7. Daily Standup Meetings
8. Sprint Review
9. Retrospective
10. Reporting
