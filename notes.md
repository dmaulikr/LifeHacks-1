  Thinking is the process of asking questions. If you get better at asking other ppl questions you get better at asking yourself questions.
  
  ## Start Small
  
  If you need to do many things.
  Which one of these makes all of the rest easier to do or irrelevant. 
  
  In the beginning: Too less than you are capable of doing. 
  E.g. flossing; to start only gonna floss my front four teeth. 
  
  Lower your standards.
  E.g. if you can't write, make it a goal to write just one sentence. 
  
  **Result:** You will feel succesful and you will exceed that for some extra credits (so you probably will do more)

  You need to take a step back and see what's wasting your time.
  
  1. Definition: find your ideal lifestyle. What do you want to be doing from when you get up to whwen you go to sleep? 
  The cost of this is going to be your target.
  
  2. Elimimination: Get rid of everything. All the static, all the noise, all the interruptions, all the micro-managing, all the people
  that interfere with getting you to your ideal life-style
  
  3. Automation: Taking the few remaining tasks that are either important or time-consuming and either delegating, automating or somehow outsourcing them.
  
  4. Liberation: Mobility. Use the time you created.
  
  26% of the ppl of the US are on the verge on a nerve breakdown.
  
  Finally: Use an auto-responder for email and calls. 
  E.g. *Hi, I check my emails twice a day and will come back to you as soon as possible*
