# Feynman Technique 

1. Take a piece of paper and write the concept's name at the top
2. Explain the concept in simple plain English
3. Identify problem areas, then go back to the sources to review
4. Pinpoint any complicated terms and challenge yourself to simplify them

**Bonus:** Ask yourself the question: "Why does this work?"
